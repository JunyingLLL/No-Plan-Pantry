# No-Plan Pantry
### Presentation 2:
We gave updates on our new project, which is an algorithm to generate easy-to-follow recipes based on users' leftover ingredients in their fridge. We created a dash app that allows users to input ingredients, as well as a callback function to take in user input for ingredients (can be seen in webapp.ipynb). We used scrapy to scrape recipes from allrecipes.com and implemented a query function get recipes based on certain criteria (ingredients, calorie range). Create a data cleaning notebook for data pre-processing for each column, using NLP to extract each recipeâ€™s main ingredients and experiment with a Transformer model to predict the NaN value of cooking time.
