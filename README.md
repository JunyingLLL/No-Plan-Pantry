# Redfin Housing Data Analysis

## Setting Up
* Here is the [link](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/#) to directly access a csv file containing all U.S. zip codes.
  * We used the free version. The csv file we used is also available in this repository. 
* [Python wrapper](https://github.com/reteps/redfin) created by another user to access data on a Redfin listing without screen scraping.
