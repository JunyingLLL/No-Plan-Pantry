Add egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about 2 minutes.
, Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1 minute, and shape,into a smooth ball. Since the dough has butter in it, it wonât be sticky.
, Return dough ball to a lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes.

, Increase speed one setting, and continue to knead until a soft, smooth, very elastic dough forms, 8 to 10 minutes. If dough seems very wet, and wonât pull away from the sides of bowl after about 5 minutes, add a little more flour in as needed. But, be careful not to add too much, or the brioche will be dry.
, Transfer dough to a work surface and shape into a ball. Transfer into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
, Transfer dough back to the work surface, press out air, and shape into a uniform log shape. Cut into 8 equal portions. For best results, use a digital scale to weigh dough, and then divide by 8, to get perfectly sized portions.
, After dividing, take each portion and cut off 15 to 20% of the dough, to use to make the smaller âtuppoâ bun on top. For uniform portions, weigh each portion in grams, and then multiply by 0.17. That will be the amount that you should cut off the portion. My portions came out to 140 grams each, and 17% of that was 24 grams, which is the size I used for the âtuppo.""
, Line a baking sheet with a silpat sheet. Roll each of the 8 larger portions into a smooth ball. Place balls seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roll the smaller portions into smooth balls, and set on the baking sheet.
, Very lightly flour your index fingers, and use them to make a deep well in the center of each of the larger bun, into which you will place the tuppo. Before placing it, squeeze one end of the tuppo into a pointed shape to make it fit better. For best results, assemble one bun at a time. Lightly press to settle the tuppo into the bottom bun, so that it is attached, with half the tuppo above the surface of the bun, and half tucked inside.
, Once all buns are formed, place baking sheet into a turned-off oven to proof until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Brush bunsÂ  gently but thoroughly with egg wash.
, Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring buns to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Stir together, and leave at room temperature until very bubbly and doubled in size, about 5 hours.
, Meanwhile, about 2 hours before the levain will be ready, perform the autolyse: Stir the 135g whole wheat flour, 365g bread flour, and 425g water together in a bowl. Let sit for about 2 hours. If levain is ready to use before the autolyse has gone a full 2 hours, proceed with mixing dough anyway.

With damp hands, pull up and fold dough from edges to the middle, turning the bowl as you fold, until completely mixed. Cover; let rest for 15 minutes. Cover and return the excess levain to the refrigerator to use for a future batch of bread.

, Turn dough out onto counter, and pre-shape dough into a ball. Dust with flour, and let rest on the counter 30 minutes.
, Perform the final shaping: Dust the counter with flour, and gently flop the dough over into the flour with the bench scraper. Again, perform a stretch and fold, but gently, to not deflate the dough. Shape into as high and round a ball as possible using the bench scraper. Dust the top with flour.
, Generously dust a banneton with rice flour, Carefully slide the bench scraper under the dough, and turn it over into the banneton. Now, and this is optional, ""stitch"" the dough by bringing opposite pieces of the dough up, sticking them together in the center. Dust with a little flour.

Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right, move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.)

, Meanwhile, place the roasting pan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil until liquids have reduced.Â  Reduce the heat to medium-low, and check the amount of rendered fat in the pan. If necessary add a 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil, so there will be enough fat to make a roux.

, Add flour and cook, stirring, for about a minute. Add lemon juice and chicken broth, and turn heat up to medium-high. Stir constantly while mixture comes back to a simmer. Add a little more broth if the sauce is too thick, or continue to simmer if sauce is too thin. Taste for salt and adjust. Reduce heat to low and keep hot until needed.
